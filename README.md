# Mengine
A simple, easy-to-learn performant game engine powered by OpenGL.
Fast. Fun. Batteries-Included.

<img src="banner.png" width="500px">

Mengine uses the blazing-fast speed and power of OpenGL and C++ to assist coders with creating scala, easy-to-manage games and 3-dimensional software alike.
There is no more need to use Python for (slow) prototyping.

Made for:
<ul>
<li>✅ Prototyping Games in C++</li>
<li>✅ Hassle-free Game Development learning</li>
<li>✅ Building lightning-fast native apps</li>
</ul>
